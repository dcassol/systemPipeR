The intended way of running _`systemPipeR`_ workflows is via _`*.Rmd`_ files, which 
can be executed either line-wise in interactive mode or with a single command from 
R or the command-line. This way comprehensive and reproducible analysis reports 
can be generated in PDF or HTML format in a fully automated manner by making use 
of the highly functional reporting utilities available for R. 
The following shows how to execute a workflow (*e.g.*, systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd)
from the command-line.


```bash
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd')"
```

Templates for setting up custom project reports are provided as _`*.Rmd`_ files by the helper package _`systemPipeRdata`_ and in the vignettes subdirectory of _`systemPipeR`_. The corresponding HTML of these report templates are available here: [_`systemPipeRNAseq`_](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/systemPipeRdata/inst/doc/systemPipeRNAseq.html), [_`systemPipeRIBOseq`_](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/systemPipeRdata/inst/doc/systemPipeRIBOseq.html), [_`systemPipeChIPseq`_](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/systemPipeRdata/inst/doc/systemPipeChIPseq.html) and [_`systemPipeVARseq`_](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/systemPipeRdata/inst/doc/systemPipeVARseq.html). To work with _`*.Rnw`_ or _`*.Rmd`_ files efficiently, basic knowledge of [_`Sweave`_](https://www.stat.uni-muenchen.de/~leisch/Sweave/) or [_`knitr`_](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and [_`Latex`_](http://www.latex-project.org/) or [_`R Markdown v2`_](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is required. 

## RNA-Seq sample

Load the RNA-Seq sample workflow into your current working directory.


```r
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow = "rnaseq")
setwd("rnaseq")
```

### Run workflow

Next, run the chosen sample workflow _`systemPipeRNAseq`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/rnaseq/systemPipeRNAseq.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/rnaseq/systemPipeRNAseq.Rmd)) by executing from the command-line _`make -B`_ within the _`rnaseq`_ directory. Alternatively, one can run the code from the provided _`*.Rmd`_ template file from within R interactively. 

The workflow includes following steps:

1. Read preprocessing
    + Quality filtering (trimming)
    + FASTQ quality report
2. Alignments: _`Tophat2`_ (or any other RNA-Seq aligner)
3. Alignment stats 
4. Read counting 
5. Sample-wise correlation analysis
6. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
7. GO term enrichment analysis
8. Gene-wise clustering

## ChIP-Seq sample

Load the ChIP-Seq sample workflow into your current working directory.


```r
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow = "chipseq")
setwd("chipseq")
```

### Run workflow

Next, run the chosen sample workflow _`systemPipeChIPseq_single`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/chipseq/systemPipeChIPseq.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/chipseq/systemPipeChIPseq.Rmd)) by executing from the command-line _`make -B`_ within the _`chipseq`_ directory. Alternatively, one can run the code from the provided _`*.Rmd`_ template file from within R interactively. 

The workflow includes the following steps:

1. Read preprocessing
    + Quality filtering (trimming)
    + FASTQ quality report
2. Alignments: _`Bowtie2`_ or _`rsubread`_
3. Alignment stats 
4. Peak calling: _`MACS2`_, _`BayesPeak`_ 
5. Peak annotation with genomic context
6. Differential binding analysis
7. GO term enrichment analysis
8. Motif analysis

## VAR-Seq sample 

### VAR-Seq workflow for the single machine

Load the VAR-Seq sample workflow into your current working directory.


```r
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow = "varseq")
setwd("varseq")
```

### Run workflow

Next, run the chosen sample workflow _`systemPipeVARseq_single`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/varseq/systemPipeVARseq_single.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/varseq/systemPipeVARseq_single.Rmd)) by executing from the command-line _`make -B`_ within the _`varseq`_ directory. Alternatively, one can run the code from the provided _`*.Rmd`_ template file from within R interactively. 

The workflow includes following steps:

1. Read preprocessing
    + Quality filtering (trimming)
    + FASTQ quality report
2. Alignments: _`gsnap`_, _`bwa`_
3. Variant calling: _`VariantTools`_, _`GATK`_, _`BCFtools`_
4. Variant filtering: _`VariantTools`_ and _`VariantAnnotation`_
5. Variant annotation: _`VariantAnnotation`_
6. Combine results from many samples
7. Summary statistics of samples

### VAR-Seq workflow for computer cluster

The workflow template provided for this step is called _`systemPipeVARseq.Rmd`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/varseq/systemPipeVARseq.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/varseq/systemPipeVARseq.Rmd)).
It runs the above VAR-Seq workflow in parallel on multiple compute nodes of an HPC system using Slurm as the scheduler. 

## Ribo-Seq sample

Load the Ribo-Seq sample workflow into your current working directory.


```r
library(systemPipeRdata)
genWorkenvir(workflow = "riboseq")
setwd("riboseq")
```

### Run workflow

Next, run the chosen sample workflow _`systemPipeRIBOseq`_ ([PDF](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/riboseq/systemPipeRIBOseq.pdf?raw=true), [Rmd](https://github.com/tgirke/systemPipeRdata/blob/master/inst/extdata/workflows/ribseq/systemPipeRIBOseq.Rmd)) by executing from the command-line _`make -B`_ within the _`ribseq`_ directory. Alternatively, one can run the code from the provided _`*.Rmd`_ template file from within R interactively. 

The workflow includes following steps:

1. Read preprocessing
    + Adaptor trimming and quality filtering
    + FASTQ quality report
2. Alignments: _`Tophat2`_ (or any other RNA-Seq aligner)
3. Alignment stats
4. Compute read distribution across genomic features
5. Adding custom features to the workflow (e.g. uORFs)

8. Sample-wise correlation analysis
9. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
10. GO term enrichment analysis
11. Gene-wise clustering
12. Differential ribosome binding (translational efficiency)
